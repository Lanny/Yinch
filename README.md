# Yinch

Browser implementation of the the board game Yinsh.

## REPL
If you've done a project that uses cljsbulid before this should be pretty straight forward but this was my first setting it up and it was kind of a pain. Also it's not exactly intuitive to fire up. First you have to start the ring server (just serving statics for now):

```
$ lein ring server 3000
```

Then you have to fireup the repl like so:

```
$ lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-launch chrome
```

Note that `chrome` must be resolve in your environment to the chrome executable. The easier way of doing this if you don't want to mess around with linking it in your path would be to start the listener:

```
$ lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-listen
```

and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/repl.html](http://localhost:3000/repl.html) in your browser manually.
